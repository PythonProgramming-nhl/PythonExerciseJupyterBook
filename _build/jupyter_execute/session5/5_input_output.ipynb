    "## Command-line parsing with argparse\n",
    "\n",
    "The `argparse` module is intended to write user-friendly command-line interfaces to Python programs. Check out [this link](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "It may become handy in one of the project assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module is build around an instance of the `class argparse.ArgumentParser`, which is nothing but a container for input argument specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to talk a bit about arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An argument is a value that is accepted by a Python function or the parser (in this case).\n",
    "* This value becomes its own Python value when used in the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Two different types of arguments**\n",
    "* Positional – required arguments that come in positional order (AND ARE ALWAYS LISTED BEFORE OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS!).\n",
    "* Optional - not required because the parameters underlying this argument has a default value (If not explicitly set in argparse using the `default` keyword, it will be set to `None`). If no argument is given, the program will use the default"
